1. Program Overview
The program creates an interactive real estate dashboard using Streamlit. The dashboard helps explore real estate prices based on various features like location, price range, number of bedrooms, and area.

2. Key Functionalities
Data Loading: The CSV file (real_estate_data.csv) is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv(). The dataset contains columns like Location, Price, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and Area.

Filtering Data: Users can filter data using:

Locations: Select specific cities from the dataset.
Price Range: Adjust a slider to set a minimum and maximum price.
Bedrooms: Choose the number of bedrooms.
Visualizations: The program displays the filtered data and provides insights through two visualizations:

Price Distribution (Histogram)
Price vs. Area (Scatter Plot)
3. How the Graphs Work
3.1 Price Distribution (Histogram)
What It Shows: A histogram groups prices into bins and shows how many properties fall into each price range.

Purpose:

Understand the distribution of property prices.
Identify the most common price ranges (e.g., are most properties in the $300K-$400K range?).
Spot outliers or skewness in pricing.
Example Use Case: If most properties are clustered in the $200K-$400K range, you know that's where demand or supply is concentrated.

3.2 Price vs. Area (Scatter Plot)
What It Shows: A scatter plot with:

X-axis: Area of the property (e.g., square feet)
Y-axis: Price of the property
Each point represents one property.

Purpose:

Explore the relationship between property size and price.
Determine trends (e.g., "Does larger area always mean higher price?").
Spot outliers (e.g., small properties that are unusually expensive).
Example Use Case: You might notice that properties with similar areas in one city are priced differently, suggesting location-based price variations.

4. How the Filters Work
Filters dynamically update the displayed data and graphs:

Multiselect Filters (Location and Bedrooms): Let you narrow the data down to specific cities or properties with a certain number of bedrooms.
Slider Filter (Price Range): Lets you focus on properties within a particular price range.
Example:

If you filter for "New York" properties priced between $400K and $600K with 3 bedrooms, only matching entries will show up in the table and graphs.

5. Why This Dashboard is Useful
Homebuyers: Explore and compare property prices in different locations.
Real Estate Agents: Identify pricing trends and market gaps.
Analysts: Analyze market dynamics and correlations between features.
